        This page serves as both the site's homepage and the place where all
        content and metadata is set. Because all other pages on this site are just
        HTML fragments that get injected into this page, if any of them are visited
        before this one, this one will need to be fetched as well so the page can be
        rebuilt properly.
        Reusable components used throughout the site are also fetched whenever this
        page is loaded (including when another page fetches it), but for ease of
        maintenance, these components are kept in separate files and fetched on page
        load.
